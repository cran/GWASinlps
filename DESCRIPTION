Description: Performs variable selection with data from Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) combining, in an iterative variable selection framework, the computational efficiency of the screen-and-select approach based on some association learning and the parsimonious uncertainty quantification provided by the use of nonlocal priors, as described in Sanyal et al. (2018).
